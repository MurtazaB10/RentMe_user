                    <p>We work on all days of the week. We do delivery, installation and pick-up. In case you do not have lift or permission to use lift at your premises, additional labor charges will be charged to carry the products through stairs.</p>

                    <h4>Do you help us with relocation?  </h4>
                    <p>We help you with relocation free of cost within the city for our rented items only. If you are relocating to another city and we are present there, you can rent similar products in the other city. The relocation service may be availed only once throughout the tenure of the contract. We suggest customers to not relocate the product themselves. If any damages occur while a customer attempts to relocate the products themselves, damage cost would be recovered from the customer. </p>

                    <h4>Who deals with labor (hamaali) union and transport union issues?  </h4>
                    <p>We deals with transport union at loading and unloading area. However, if there is labor (hamaali) union issues at your location and they do not allow us to unload at your place, you have to deal with them. In worst cases, we will take the items back without delivering and we will bear the logistics cost. Chances of labor union issues are very less. </p>

Please also ensure that you have completed the required documents and payment work mandatory with the landlord, we have observed that sometimes customers do not have permission to shift into the new house. </p>
